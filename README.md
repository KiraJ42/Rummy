<b> Dummy Rummy Rules</b>
<p><i>The Deck</i></p>
&emsp;Two standard decks of 54 cards (Jokers included), shuffled together
<p>&emsp;&emsp;A 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 J Q K</p> 
<p>&emsp;&emsp;jokers are wild cards</p>
<p><i>Object:</i></p>
&emsp;To dispose of all the cards in your hand by creating the specified number of sets or runs according to the round
<p>&emsp;&emsp;<i>Set</i>: at least 3 cards of the same rank (3 7s, 3 Qs, 3 Ks, etc.)</p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;<i>Run</i>: at least four cards of the same suit in ascending or descending order</p>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;<b>NOTE</b>: Aces may be high or low but not both 
<p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; Q K A 2 is not a valid run, but J Q K A and A 2 3 4 are valid</p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;<i>Rounds</i>:</p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;<b>Round 1</b>: Two sets</p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;<b>Round 2</b>: One set and one run</p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;<b>Round 3</b>: Two runs</p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;<b>Round 4</b>: Three sets</p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;<b>Round 5</b>: Two sets and one run</p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;<b>Round 6</b>: One set and two runs</p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;<b>Round 7</b>: Three runs</p>
<p><i>Play:</i></p>
<p>&emsp; 1. The deck is spread face down on the table and each player picks a card. The highest card is the dealer (aces are low). &emsp;&emsp; Each round the player to the left of the dealer will become the new dealer</p>
<p>&emsp; 2. Each player recieves 11 cards. Once every player is ready the dealer places the left over cards in the center of the table &emsp;&emsp; and turns up the top card to begin the discard pile. The player to the dealer's left has the option of picking up the &emsp; &emsp;&emsp;revealed card  or choosing the top card from the stack. Each player must pick up a card to begin their turn and discard  &emsp;&emsp;to end their turn. </p>
<p>&emsp;3. Once a player has completed the requirements of a round they may choose a card to begin their turn and lay down &emsp;&emsp;their completed sets and/or runs before discarding to end their turn. Once a player has laid down, other players who &emsp;&emsp;have also laid down may play on their revealed cards.
<p>&emsp;4. To win a round a player must have completed the requirements of the round and have chosen a card from the stack to &emsp;&emsp;begin their turn. Players cannot win on a discard and must have at least one card in their hand at all times unless they &emsp;&emsp;have won. So the player must be able to play both their cards on either their own hand or another player's in order to &emsp;&emsp;win the round.</p>
<p><i>Scoring</i></p>
<p>&emsp;Aces = 50 points</p>
<p>&emsp;Aces = 20 points</p>
<p>&emsp;10, Jack, Queen, King  = 10 points</p>
<p>&emsp;All others = 5 points</p>
<p>&emsp;At the end of each round players add up the number of points left in their hand (with the winner receving a star to 
<p>&emsp;represent 0 points). The round total is then added to each player's total score.</p>
